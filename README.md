## Getting Started

Deploy the app to Digital Ocean and get the apk from the generated web server. If you are a open-source contributor, follow the below steps:

* Clone the app, and run ``flutter pub get``.
* Run ``flutter test`` to execute the smoke test.
* Build the app and run on any device after the above tests.
* Run ``pod install`` and install all the Firebase modules, which can be viewed on ``pubspec.yaml`` needed for iOS devices.
